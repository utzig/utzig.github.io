Maybe
a little longer than a few weeks! Anyway, after a lot of work and music
listening, which is mostly jazz and fusion these days, I'm getting somewhat
better at learning songs by ear. There's a song by the band Ohm:, the
band of the great guitar player Chris Poland, that I really love and made
a quick and dirty cover this afternoon. You can watch it here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;I feel quite proud of learning the whole song by ear, without any kind of
tablature and transcription help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the next post, hopefully, will be about programming! :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>guitar</category><guid>https://fabioutzig.com/posts/back-to-guitar-playing/</guid><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jun 2013 03:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
