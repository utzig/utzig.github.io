I've been practicing some guitar playing on the last few weeks. Maybe
a little longer than a few weeks! Anyway, after a lot of work and music
listening, which is mostly jazz and fusion these days, I'm getting somewhat
better at learning songs by ear. There's a song by the band Ohm:, the
band of the great guitar player Chris Poland, that I really love and made
a quick and dirty cover this afternoon. You can watch it here:

I feel quite proud of learning the whole song by ear, without any kind of
tablature and transcription help.

And the next post, hopefully, will be about programming! :)
