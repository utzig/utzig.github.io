<p>I'm writing this post because today I <em>fixed</em> the serial port of my Nexys2
board. This will mainly highlight how we can get trapped in some way of
thinking when we're pretty sure about something and not contemplate a whole
spectrum of options surrounding it. It will be somewhat shameful I guess,
but let's see if you can find the solution more easily than I did!</p>
<p>A month ago or so I was working on learning Verilog and was writing some code.
I got to a point where I wanted to test a softcore and I needed to upload code
through the serial port. While getting there, I made a <em>port</em> of the lattice
mico32 softcore to my board. Actually the hard work was already done and I only
had to make some very small adaptations. I used the code from this repo:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/optixx/lm32">https://github.com/optixx/lm32</a></p>
<p>The problem was that it booted, sent a prompt throught the serial port but I
could not input commands. If you look at the code at <em>firmware/boot0-serial/main.c</em>
you'll see that what it does is this:</p>
<pre class="code cpp"><a name="rest_code_ffbba2ec7be54995a409bcea3fbc5ea5-1"></a><span class="n">uart_putstr</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"**soc-lm32/bootloader** &gt; </span><span class="se">\r\n</span><span class="s">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<a name="rest_code_ffbba2ec7be54995a409bcea3fbc5ea5-2"></a><span class="n">c</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">uart_getchar</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre>
<p>I'm omitting the irrelevant code. So I got the prompt but no data that I sent from
the computer ever got in to the Nexys2.
Since the lm32 is a quite complex softcore I thought that maybe it had
some problems and ended up testing other UART cores. Actually I ended up writing
my own which is at this repo (in the directory <em>uart</em>):</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/utzig/nexys2-verilog-samples">https://github.com/utzig/nexys2-verilog-samples</a> (btw, this is not good code!)</p>
<p>The results were the same. It worked in the transmit direction only.</p>
<p>The schematics for the Nexys2 UART converter is this:</p>
<img alt="/images/nexys2_uart.png" src="../../images/nexys2_uart.png"><p>I put an oscilloscope on the RX signal and tried to find out what was
happening. So here's how a RS232 UART works. The TX/RX lines are usually
in high level. When you send data,
the first thing it does is to send the <em>START</em> bit. A <em>START</em> bit is
characterized by a transition from high to low level. The data bits go next
and at last the <em>STOP</em> bit (or bits). What was happening here was that the
RX line would go
to low level and stay that way. It would never go back to high level. No data
was going through. To get it back to working state I had to disconnect/reconnect.</p>
<p>I started suspecting my the issue was with my USB &lt;-&gt; RS232 adapter. I got
another board (an ARM CM3 powered devboard) and wrote some code for doing
serial communications. This ended up working and I got data in and out. So
it was clear the problem was not with my serial adapter. Btw, here are the
schematics of the board I used to do the test (Olimex STM32-P103):</p>
<img alt="/images/stm32-p103-uart.png" src="../../images/stm32-p103-uart.png"><p>The conclusion then was that the problem was either with the pin used for RX on
my FPGA or with the onboard TTL &lt;-&gt; RS232 converter. So I ended up buying some extra
converters to test it. And these things are not easy to get here in Brazil.
But I found them at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.multcomercial.com.br">Multcomercial</a>. They arrived yesterday and this morning I
removed the old ST3232 and put a new MAX3232 chip. You can see the final result
below:</p>
<img alt="/images/max3232.jpg" src="../../images/max3232.jpg"><p>As you can see I ended up destroying one onboard wire and had to fix with normal
wire. When I turned it on, data came out and when I sent data nothing came in.
Shit!!!</p>
<p>So, the problem must be with the FPGA pin, right? Actually no, it isn't.</p>
<p>Let's look harder at schematics! There are some difference between the two boards.
The STM32 has the main lines (RX/TX/GND) connected in the standard way but
it has also the CTS/RTS lines connected to the converter and has a resistor
between DTR and DSR. The Nexys2 has the RX/TX/GND lines connected the same
way but RTS is connected to CTS (no connection to the converter) and
DSR/DTR/DCD are all connected together. Interesting, right?.</p>
<p>I got a spare serial cable, soldered the 3 pins which matter (RX/TX/GND),
tried again and voilá... data out and data in.</p>
<p>Sometimes we get stuck with knowing for sure that we know what's happening
but turns out we don't (at least it applies to me!).</p>
